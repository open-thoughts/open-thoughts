  <i>Curating the best open reasoning datasets</i><br>
  A collaboration led by <a href="https://bespokelabs.ai/">Bespoke Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.datacomp.ai/">DataComp</a> community

</p>
<hr>

Our first goal is to curate a reasoning dataset to train state-of-the-art small reasoning models that surpass [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) on math and code reasoning benchmarks.

[OpenThinker-7B](https://huggingface.co/open-thoughts/OpenThinker-7B) vs other 7B models:

|                             | AIME24   | MATH500 | GPQA-Diamond | LCBv2 Easy  | LCBv2 Medium  | LCBv2 Hard  | LCBv2 All  |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| OpenThinker-7B              | 31.3     | 83.0    | 42.4         | 75.3        | 28.6          | 6.5         | 39.9       |

Note: The AIME24 dataset has a small sample size, resulting in high variance in evaluation accuracy. To mitigate this, we updated the code to compute the average score over five evaluation runs with different seeds. No system prompt is used, the maximum token length is set to 32,768, and temperature is 0.7.

We are fully open-source. Our [model weights](https://huggingface.co/open-thoughts), [datasets](https://huggingface.co/open-thoughts), [data generation code](https://github.com/open-thoughts/open-thoughts), [evaluation code](https://github.com/mlfoundations/Evalchemy), and [training code](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) are all publicly available.

# Installation

```sh
make install
poetry shell
```

Set the DeepSeek API key:

```sh
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Set HF_ORG to your organization id. Set HF_PRIVATE=true if you want to push to a private repo.

```sh
export HF_ORG=your_org_id
export HF_PRIVATE=false
```

# Data Generation

Currently, we are generating data for the following domains:

1. Code
2. Math
3. Science
4. Puzzle

The recipe is outlined below:
